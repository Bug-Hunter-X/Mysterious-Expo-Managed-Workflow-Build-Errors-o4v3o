This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the managed workflow, particularly when dealing with native modules or interacting with underlying native functionalities.  The error messages are often vague and don't pinpoint the exact cause, making debugging difficult.  For example, during the build process, you might get cryptic errors related to linking libraries, missing dependencies, or incompatibility between Expo SDK versions and native libraries.  These issues can arise from incorrect configurations in your `app.json` or `package.json`, or from problems with the native modules themselves.
