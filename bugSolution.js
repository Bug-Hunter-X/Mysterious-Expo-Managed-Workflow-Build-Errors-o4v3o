// Solution: Carefully review your app.json, package.json and ensure all dependencies (especially native modules) are correctly configured and compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Examine the build logs closely for any clues about missing dependencies or linking issues.
// Try cleaning the project's cache, using the command expo prebuild --clean, followed by a fresh build.  Consider using the EAS Build service for a more stable and reliable build process.  If you are using a third-party native module, check its documentation for any known compatibility issues or specific build instructions for Expo.
// If the problem persists, consult the Expo community forums or create a GitHub issue for support. 
const myNativeModule = require('./MyNativeModule'); // Example of a native module interaction

// ... rest of your code ...

myNativeModule.doSomething().then(() => {
//Handle Success
}).catch((error) => {
//Handle Error
});
